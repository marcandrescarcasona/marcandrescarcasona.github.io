I'm a physicist and postdoctoral researcher at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/), where I work on gravitational-wave astrophysics, focusing on both instrumental and data analysis topics.

### 🧠 Research Interests

- **Gravitational-wave detection** and noise mitigation  
- **Scattered light modeling** and control for current and next-gen detectors  
- **Primordial black holes (PBHs)** and their detectability via mergers  
- **Machine learning applications** in signal classification and anomaly detection  

### 🛰️ Current Projects

- Development of tools for scattered light modelling (`SCATTER`)  
- Searches for PBHs in LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA data  
- Supervised learning for GW signal detection and parameter estimation

### 📍 Background

I completed my PhD in Physics with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and early-universe cosmology.  
My academic work bridges theory, instrumentation, and data science.
