Welcome! I'm Dr. **Marc Andr√©s Carcasona**, a postdoctoral researcher in gravitational-wave astrophysics currently based at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/) in Barcelona.  


My work focuses on:

- Scattered light noise in interferometric gravitational wave detectors  
- Primordial black holes as dark matter candidates  
- Machine learning techniques for data analysis

In this webpage you can find a bit of my research as well as a bit about me:
